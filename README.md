# Matplotlib_Homework

This is my submission for the Matplotlib Homework.

The data was presented and analysed in a Jupyter Notebook, 6.1.4, with a Python kernel, 3.8.5. Data was imported from mouse _metadata.csv_ and study _results.csv_ and manipulated using pandas 1.1.3. Pandas was also used along with numpy 1.19.2 and scipy 1.5.2 to calculated descriptive statistics and matplotlib 3.3.2 was used to create graphs.
